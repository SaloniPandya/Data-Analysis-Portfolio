In this study, I explored strategies to convert casual riders to annual members, crucial for Cyclistic's, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, future growth.

Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering in 2016, growing to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles across 692 stations in Chicago. The bikes are geotracked and can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Role and Objective: As a junior data analyst at Cyclistic, my role was to analyze historical trip data to understand the usage patterns of casual riders and annual members. The goal was to design a data-driven marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. 

Stakeholders: The stakeholders for this project included the marketing team at Cyclistic.
